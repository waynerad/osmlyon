# osmlyon
Exploration of Open Street Map data from Lyon, France

The code here is for a Udacity data wrangling assignment for wrangling data from the OpenStreetMap, retrieved through the Overpass API, described at https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API . The location I chose was Lyon, France. The PDF file is the report.

osmparse.py is the Python code that parses the OSM. It requires the OSM file to be called lyon.osm and to be in the same directory to run. It is designed to run using Python 3 and is not guaranteed to work in Python 2.

The data is not in this repository due to size. It's available at http://waynerad.com/files/lyon.zip .
